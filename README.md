## Algorithm and Data Structure

This directory stores content focused on the complex study of Algorithms and Data Structures using Java.
> Note that this section will present content similar to the syllabus provided by PUC Minas (Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais).

## Beecrowd

This repository stores my authored solutions to the learning exercises available on the Beecrowd site. 
> Usually, the exercises found in this repository aim to test logic and reasoning, so it will be in a separate directory from the common exercises

## Exercises
This repository stores my authored solutions to some learning exercises from different sources. 
> Usually the exercises in this repository will require an understanding of a specific structure, and are only somewhat objective.

## Frameworks

This directory stores the framework files used for algorithm development.
> I declare that none of the files in this directory are my own. All rights reserved to the authors.

## Notes and Summaries

This directory stores files that simulate a summary of some Java-related content.
